# [0630-course-schedule-iii](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-iii/)

## Problem
<div><p>There are <code>n</code> different online courses numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. Each course has some duration(course length) <code>t</code> and closed on <code>d<sub>th</sub></code> day. A course should be taken <b>continuously</b> for <code>t</code> days and must be finished before or on the <code>d<sub>th</sub></code> day. You will start at the <code>1<sub>st</sub></code> day.</p><br><br><p>Given <code>n</code> online courses represented by pairs <code>(t,d)</code>, your task is to find the maximal number of courses that can be taken.</p><br><br><p><b>Example:</b></p><br><br><pre><b>Input:</b> [[100, 200], [200, 1300], [1000, 1250], [2000, 3200]]<br><b>Output:</b> 3<br><b>Explanation:</b> <br>There're totally 4 courses, but you can take 3 courses at most:<br>First, take the 1st course, it costs 100 days so you will finish it on the 100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 101st day.<br>Second, take the 3rd course, it costs 1000 days so you will finish it on the 1100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 1101st day. <br>Third, take the 2nd course, it costs 200 days so you will finish it on the 1300th day. <br>The 4th course cannot be taken now, since you will finish it on the 3300th day, which exceeds the closed date.<br></pre><br><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p><b>Note:</b></p><br><br><ol><br>	<li>The integer 1 &lt;= d, t, n &lt;= 10,000.</li><br>	<li>You can't take two courses simultaneously.</li><br></ol><br><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br></div>

## Solution

java
```java
class Solution {
    public int scheduleCourse(int[][] courses) {    
        //first, we need to deal with the course with early deadline!
        //second, we want to put the course taking shorter time.
        //!!!so, if we take the same amount of courses, we prefer the strategy with shorter time.
        //Then, we can use greedy to sort the course with deadline first
        //Then, when we gradaully add our courses into our plan, if more than our expectation, poll the courses which taking longest time.
        
        Arrays.sort(courses, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] c1, int[] c2) {
                return c1[1] - c2[1];
            }
        });
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] c1, int[] c2) {
                return c2[0] - c1[0];
            }
        });
        
        int time = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < courses.length; i++) {
            int[] course = courses[i];
            pq.offer(course);
            time += course[0];
            if (time > course[1]) {
                int[] notTake = pq.poll();
                time -= notTake[0];
            }
        }
        return pq.size();
    }
}
