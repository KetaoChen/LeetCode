# [0621-task-scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/)

## Problem
<div><p>Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks. Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.</p><br><br><p>However, there is a non-negative cooling interval <b>n</b> that means between two <b>same tasks</b>, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.</p><br><br><p>You need to return the <b>least</b> number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.</p><br><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p><b>Example:</b></p><br><br><pre><b>Input:</b> tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2<br><b>Output:</b> 8<br><b>Explanation:</b> A -&gt; B -&gt; idle -&gt; A -&gt; B -&gt; idle -&gt; A -&gt; B.<br></pre><br><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p><b>Note:</b></p><br><br><ol><br>	<li>The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].</li><br>	<li>The integer n is in the range [0, 100].</li><br></ol><br></div>

## Solution

java
```java
class Solution {
    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        //for every n + 1 interval, put the task in from the highest to lowest task numbers.
        //So there are just two situations.
        //First, all the task can be executed without idle. --> res = tasks.lengt;
        //Second, some of the task has too many so that all the other tasks can not fill all the idle interval.
        //in the second situation. res = the task with most times add all the idle interval.
        //all the tasks with maxCount will fill in the last interval.
        HashMap<Character, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c : tasks) {
            count.put(c, count.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        int max = 0;
        int maxNum = 0;
        for (char c : count.keySet()) {
            if (count.get(c) > max) {
                max = count.get(c);
                maxNum = 1;
            }
            else if (count.get(c) == max) {
                maxNum++;
            }
        }
        int left = tasks.length - max;
        int space = n * max;
        if (space < left) {
            return tasks.length;
        }
        return max * (n + 1) - (n + 1 - maxNum);
    }
}
