# 0337-house-robber-iii

## Problem

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.  
  


Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.  
  


**Example 1:**  
  


```text
Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1

Output: 7 
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**  
  


```text
Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1

Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
```

## Solution

java

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    //the thief can choose to rob the root, or not.
        //if rot, then he can not rob the children of root
        //if not, he can rob both rob tree
    //HashMap<TreeNode, Integer> represent that the maximum value the thief can rob in the tree, when root is node

    public int rob(TreeNode root) {
        int[] res = helper(root);
        return Math.max(res[0], res[1]);
    }

    private int[] helper(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return new int[]{0, 0};
        }
​
        int[] left = helper(root.left);
        int[] right = helper(root.right);

        int[] res = new int[2];
        //when we rob the root
        res[0] = root.val + left[1] + right[1];
        //not rob
        //!!!!!!important, when not rob the root, we can choose both rob the children or not
        res[1] = Math.max(left[0], left[1]) + Math.max(right[0], right[1]);
​
        return res;
    }
