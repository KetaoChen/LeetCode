# LinkedList

## Tech
1. Reverse: 92
2. Slow & Fast Pointer: 
    - check circle
    - find the mid point of the list: 148
3. Use dummy Node
4. Since linkedlist can not check prev, sometimes we need prev pointer to record


## Tricks
  - NullPointerException: make sure to check null for each node
  - Last node needs to point to null
  - Need to ask whether the pointer or the value is mutable
  - Check whether is a double-linked-list or single
