# [0808-soup-servings](https://leetcode.com/problems/soup-servings/)

## Problem
<div><p>There are two types of soup: type A and type B. Initially we have <code>N</code> ml of each type of soup. There are four kinds of operations:</p><br><br><ol><br>	<li>Serve&nbsp;100 ml of soup A and 0 ml of soup B</li><br>	<li>Serve&nbsp;75 ml of soup A and 25&nbsp;ml of soup B</li><br>	<li>Serve 50 ml of soup A and 50 ml of soup B</li><br>	<li>Serve 25&nbsp;ml of soup A and 75&nbsp;ml of soup B</li><br></ol><br><br><p>When we serve some soup, we give it to someone and we no longer have it.&nbsp; Each turn,&nbsp;we will choose from the four operations with equal probability 0.25. If the remaining volume of soup is not enough to complete the operation, we will serve&nbsp;as much as we can.&nbsp; We stop once we no longer have some quantity of both types of soup.</p><br><br><p>Note that we do not have the operation where all 100 ml's of soup B are used first.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>Return the probability that soup A will be empty&nbsp;first, plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time.</p><br><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><pre><strong>Example:</strong><br><strong>Input:</strong> N = 50<br><strong>Output:</strong> 0.625<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> <br>If we choose the first two operations, A will become empty first. For the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time. For the fourth operation, B will become empty first. So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.<br><br></pre><br><br><p><strong>Notes: </strong></p><br><br><ul><br>	<li><code>0 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^9</code>.&nbsp;</li><br>	<li>Answers within&nbsp;<code>10^-6</code>&nbsp;of the true value will be accepted as correct.</li><br></ul><br></div>

## Solution

java
```java
class Solution {
    public double soupServings(int N) {
        //within 1E-6, check the upper bound that A must be empty first.
        //we found when N >= 5000, it > 0.999999
        
        if (N >= 5000) {
            return 1.0;
        }
        
        //as each serving at least 25ml.
        //change N to serving.
        N = N % 25 == 0 ? N / 25 : N / 25 + 1;
        //four possibilities, (4,0),(3,1),(2,2),(1,3)
        int[] dx = {4, 3, 2, 1};
        int[] dy = {0, 1, 2, 3};
        
        double[][] dp = new double[N + 1][N + 1];
        //initi when i == 0, j != 0 dp[i][j] = 1, i == 0 && j == 0 dp[i][j] = 0.5; i != 0 && j == 0
        dp[0][0] = 0.5;
        for (int j = 1; j <= N; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = 1;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= N; j++) {
                for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
                    int nowI = i - dx[k];
                    int nowJ = j - dy[k];
                    if (nowI <= 0 && nowJ <= 0) {
                        dp[i][j] += 0.5;
                    }
                    else if (nowI <= 0 && nowJ > 0) {
                        dp[i][j] += 1.0;
                    }
                    else if (nowI > 0 && nowJ > 0) {
                        dp[i][j] += dp[nowI][nowJ];
                    }
                }
                dp[i][j] /= 4.0;
            }
        }
        return dp[N][N];
    }
}
