# 0174-dungeon-game

## Problem

table.dungeon, .dungeon th, .dungeon td {&lt;br&gt;  border:3px solid black;&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; .dungeon th, .dungeon td {&lt;br&gt;    text-align: center;&lt;br&gt;    height: 70px;&lt;br&gt;    width: 70px;&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;  


The demons had captured the princess \(**P**\) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight \(**K**\) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.  
  


The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.  
  


Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health \(_negative_ integers\) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty \(_0's_\) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health \(_positive_ integers\).  
  


In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.  
  


**Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.**  
  


For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least **7** if he follows the optimal path `RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN`.  
  


|   |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|   |  |  |  |
|   | -2 \(K\) | -3 | 3 |
|   |  |  |  |
|   | -5 | -10 | 1 |
|   |  |  |  |
|   | 10 | 30 | -5 \(P\) |
|   |  |  |  |
|   |  |  |  |

**Note:**  
  


* * The knight's health has no upper bound.
* * Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.
* 
## Solution

java

```java
class Solution {
    public int calculateMinimumHP(int[][] dungeon) {
        if (dungeon == null || dungeon.length == 0 || dungeon[0].length == 0) return 0;

        int m = dungeon.length;
        int n = dungeon[0].length;
​
        int[][] health = new int[m][n];
​
        health[m - 1][n - 1] = Math.max(1 - dungeon[m - 1][n - 1], 1);
​
        for (int i = m - 2; i >= 0; i--) {            
            health[i][n - 1] = Math.max(health[i + 1][n - 1] - dungeon[i][n - 1], 1);
        }
​
        for (int j = n - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
            health[m - 1][j] = Math.max(health[m - 1][j + 1] - dungeon[m - 1][j], 1);
        }
​
        for (int i = m - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = n - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
                int down = Math.max(health[i + 1][j] - dungeon[i][j], 1);
                int right = Math.max(health[i][j + 1] - dungeon[i][j], 1);
                health[i][j] = Math.min(right, down);
            }
        }
​
        return health[0][0];
    }

}
